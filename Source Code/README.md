# Source Code

This directory contains the implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Large Language Models (LLM), and Transformer-based models for SafeScan. These models were trained to detect vulnerabilities and non-vulnerabilities in coding practices. The trained models are utilized in detect.py for real-time security scanning.
